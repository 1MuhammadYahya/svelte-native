After my experience creating a PWA using preact and shipping with getCapactior, I was looking for a way to write mobile apps that aren't just a big web view. I found Nativescript-Vue, but I didn't want to use Vue. I wanted to use the next generation of web frameworks, namely Svelte. In particular, Svelte's upcoming version 3.

The marriage of Svelte's tiny payloads and speedy DOM updates seem like a perfect fit for mobile development and shortly afterward, Svelte Native was born.
